# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Summary
For this project, we were hired by Planmytrip, a travel technology company. They specialize in internet related services in the hotel and lounging industry. We worked alonside Jack, who is the head of analysis for the user-interface team. We worked on collecting and presenting data for customers via the the search page. The objective was to help the clients find their ideal hotel, anywhere in the world. We also worked on making a few changes on the app that clients have  recommended to take the app to the next level. 

## Project Specs
Specifically, they recommended adding the weather description to the weather data. What we accomplished was creating a beta program that allows beta testers to input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences. Then the program identifies potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester choses four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, it creates a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map. In general, it is a great app that will make traveling easier for every client that choses Planmytrip.
